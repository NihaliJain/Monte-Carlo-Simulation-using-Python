# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

Fast food restaurants are popular among price-sensitive youths and working adults who runs short of time and expects to receive service quickly. Moreover, the promotional lunch meals attract good response, resulting in occasional long queues and inconvenient waiting times. Thus, a simulation model can be used to analyze the system in a fast-food restaurant. For this project, I have taken a restaurant located on the Green Street (Which Which). The purpose of this simulation is to examine the average waiting time for the customerâ€™s turn and based on the results, determine the serving rate in order to reduce the waiting time. This will help to improve customer service, with reference to reducing waiting time in the queue and shortening queue length by adding one more cashier to improve customer wait time.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:


Null Hypothesis:
There is no association between the customer's waiting time and the rate of number of items entered by the cashier.

Alternate Hypothesis: 
There is an association between the customer's waiting time and the rate of number of items entered by the cashier.
 

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty. 
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

To model this situation, I considered 3 customers arriving per min on average (either at the counter if cashier is free or in the queue if cashier is busy). This means that on average there will be one customer every 20 seconds. For every second we can simulate the chance that a customer comes by generating a random number between 1 and 20. If the number is 20, this means a customer is in the queue. Also, customers may order between 1 to 10 items. If each item from 1 to 10 is equally likely, then the items taken by each customer can be simulated using a random number between 1 and 10 inclusive.  
## Instructions on how to use the program:

The proposed simulation runs by taking two parameters, first parameter is the time frame for the simulation and the second parameter is the number of items (entered by the cashier) per min. By adjusting the number of items entered per min and running the trials again for the same time frame, we can observe how the simulation result changes according to the rate of number of items entered by the cashier. Here, I took an example with time frame of 600 seconds and number of items per min in the range (10,11,....till 50). I ran 10 simulations for every value of items per min taken (between 10 to 50) and for better visualization of the scenario, I have made a plot from all the simulation results (showing maximum, minimum and the average cases among all 10 simulations ran everytime for items per min = 10,11,12,....till 50) while taking a fixed time frame= 600 seconds.

## Results Obtained:
The simulation result rejects the null hypothesis in favour of alternate hypothesis and confirms that there is an association between the customer's waiting time and the rate of number of items entered by the cashier. As we increase the number of items entered per min for a given time frame, we can observe that more number of customers are being served and the average time for the customer has been reduced. So, in order to increase the number of items entered per min, we need the cashier to be speedy. But after a certain amount of time, there will be a human saturation and only one cashier won't be able to meet the requirement of such fast serving rate. Hence, we can conclude that the restaurant should increase the number of cashiers in order to increase the serving rate (items entered) and to eventually minimize the customer's wait time. Also, for robust simulation results we can take the real data.
